I'm Ree, and I love turning complex tech ideas into products that actually make sense. Think of me as a bridge between the mystical world of blockchain and the people who use it! Currently vibing in sunny Lisbon 🌞

> "If technology is a superpower, then product strategy is learning to fly without crashing into buildings" - Me, probably

## 🎯 What gets me excited?

* Building stuff that makes finance less boring and more accessible
* Geeking out over blockchain and crypto innovations
* Leading teams that turn "wait, what if we..." into "holy cow, we did it!"
* Finding elegant solutions to messy problems

## 🛠 My toolbox includes
* Product strategy that actually works
* Deep dive into blockchain wizardry
* A knack for making APIs play nice together
* Enough coffee to fuel a small rocket launch

## 💭 Current thoughts...

I'm fascinated by how we can use blockchain to reshape the future of money. When I'm not crafting product roadmaps or diving into technical specs, you'll find me exploring new FinTech trends or brainstorming the next big thing in decentralized finance.

## 🤝 Let's create something awesome!
